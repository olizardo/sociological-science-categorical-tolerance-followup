## Categorical Tolerance As a Social Fact

- What is **categorical tolerance**?
  - Refusal to report dislikes in survey data on cultural (usually musical) tastes
  - Anchoring at "neutral" or "mixed feelings"
- Riff on Bryson (1996) who used musical dislikes as an extension of the notion of political tolerance into the cultural realm

## Categorical Tolerance As a Social Fact

- What is **categorical tolerance**?
  - Refusal to report dislikes in survey data on cultural (usually musical) tastes
  - Anchoring at "neutral" or "mixed feelings"
- Riff on Bryson (1996) who used musical dislikes as an extension of the notion of political tolerance into the cultural realm

- More prosaically:  
  - People with zero dislikes in a cultural taste survey (categorical tolerants)
  - Excess zeros in the count distribution dislikes at the population level
  - Structural zeros in a hurdle count model

- One comparable study by Lindbloom (2022)
- Two wave cross-section: 2007 - 2018
- Finnish Context
- 13 Musical Genres
  - Some, but not perfect overlap with Lizardo & Skiles (2016)

- Findings: 
  - Categorical tolerance (CT) increases over time:
    - 14% versus 20%
  - No connection between CT and political and social attitudes
  - Only consistent predictor of CT is age:
    - Younger more likely to belong to CT group
    - Similar to Lizardo & Skiles (2016)

- Most of the categorical tolerance over-estimation comes from smaller data collection wave in 2021
  - Middle of Covid Pandemic

- Categorical Tolerance 2023:

## Conclusions
- Categorical Tolerance continues to be a social fact!
  - Highlights value of replication of previous work using newer/different data
- Similarity in results with previous work in the U.S. re-assuring
  - CTs are non-white and young today as they were in 2012
- Similarity with results from a different national contemporary national case suggest generic not case-specific mechanisms
  - Especially with regard to the cohort/age effect
  - Race effect could be specific to the U.S. Context
- Need work using other methodological strategies (interview, experimental, computational) to crack the puzzle
